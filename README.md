# Random Animal Facts

Dive into a world of amazing animal facts with this interactive React application! Click on beautifully rendered images of dolphins, lobsters, and starfish to uncover fascinating and fun trivia about each creature. Built with modern web technologies like React and Vite, this project showcases dynamic content updates, a responsive layout, and a clean, component-based architecture. Perfect for animal lovers and aspiring developers alike, it's a simple yet engaging demonstration of what's possible with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
